Dream is a strong desire to achieve something in life. I believes everybody has their own dreams and keeps moving towards our goals. My Dream is to become a successful scientist. The main area where I would like to focus my attention is the medical and pharmaceutical sector. As a scientist, I would conduct research to develop cheaper varieties of medicines and pharmaceutical products so that the poor people can afford them. I would like to find medicines for non-curable diseases and invent cost-effective devices using robotics for early detection of diseases like Cancer, Stroke and other possibilities for Organ transplantation and life-threatening disease.
