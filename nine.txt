I am a student.. My daily life is very simple. I get up early in the morning. I wash my hands and face. Then I go . to for a walk. I walk for half an hour as it refreshes me. I come back and take my breakfast. I eat an egg and drink a cup of tea. Then I sit down to prepare my homework. I read for two hours. After finishing my study. I put on my school dress and go school. I reach school punctually. I like to sit on the first bench I attend school regularly.

I am very attentive in the class. I wash my hands and take my food. I put on my school dress and go school. I listen carefully to what the teachers say. There are some naughty boys in my class. I do not like them. I mix with good boys. After the fourth period, we have a recess for half an hour I go to the reading-room and read book or a magazine. I do not like to waste my time. This is my daily life. I try to utilize every day. Time is very valuable for us. We should not waste it.
