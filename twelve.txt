It was one of the most memorable days in my life when my father announced that the coming weekend we all will go and watch circus. I couldn’t control my excitement and jumped up and down as I don’t know how I managed to spend that Saturday night. I was not able to sleep properly. The day came. The show was scheduled for 4 pm. Myself, my sister, dad and mom took a 20 minutes’ drive to Marine Drive where the great Majestic circus was running for the last one week.
