My favourite subject in school is English. It is quite easy and pleasant to study it. English is used in each field of life and it is useful to know it. Most of web sites are in English. It is nice to be able to use such a sites like Yahoo, MSN and English Wikipedia. I can get a lot of information and news in English. I can use English books and magazines. Sometimes I like to download e-books and magazines in pdf. It is effectively way to study English in home. Using English, I can communicate with many peoples. I can use Skype and ICQ to talk and chat and get new contacts. Most of movies are in English.
